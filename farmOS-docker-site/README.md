# Cookiecutter farmOS Module

Powered by [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), [Cookiecutter farmOS Docker Site](https://github.com/fosten/cookiecutter-farmOS/farmOS-docker-site) is intended to be used by farmOS developers to create farmOS docker sites based on custom images.

## Getting Started üèÅ

### Prerequisites

- **pipx**: A handy tool for installing and running Python applications.
- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment.

### Installation Guide üõ†Ô∏è

1. **pipx**

```shell
pip install pipx
```

2. **Docker**

Visit the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation guides.

### Generate Your farmOS Project üéâ

```shell
pipx run cookiecutter gh:collective/cookiecutter-farmos
```
Then select the `farmOS Docker Site` template.

Note: While not required, you will likely want to run these cookiecutter templates first:
- `farmOS Site Config`
- `farmOS Contrib Module`
so they can be included in your `farmOS Docker Site` image.

## Project Generation Options üõ†Ô∏è

Every project is unique, and we provide a variety of options to ensure that your farmOS project aligns with your specific needs. Here are the options you can customize during the generation process:
